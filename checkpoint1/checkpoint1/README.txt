Pre-requisites:

Questions #1, #2, and #3 require having loaded the CPDB dataset.

Question #4 requires having loaded the Settlements dataset.

---------------------------------------

Questions and Instructions:

Question #1: What's the percentage of allegations that are sustained?

To answer this question, you should execute the query in "src/q1.sql" and consider the unit of the one-line result (named "percent_sustained") as percentage. Full context may be found in "findings.pdf."

Question #2: What's the average investigation time measured from its start to the first decision?

To answer this question, you should execute the query in "src/q2.sql" and consider the unit of the one-line result (named "avg") as days. Full context may be found in "findings.pdf."

Question #3: What's the most common type of disciplinary action?

To answer this question, you should execute the query in "src/q3.sql" and read the resulting lines (three) as a top 3 of the most frequent disciplinary actions (field "final_outcome" indicates the disciplinary action and "freq" its frequency). Full context may be found in "findings.pdf."

Question #4: What's the average compensation amount measured from settlements?

To answer this question, you should execute the query in "src/q4.sql" and consider the unit of the one-line result (named "avg") as dollars. Full context may be found in "findings.pdf."
