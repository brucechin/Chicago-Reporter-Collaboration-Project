You can run code/extract_data.sql to get the training and testing data, which is alreadly placed at data/*.csv

you can map the codes to corresponding questions easily by their file name.

**Before you reproduce using our code:**

1. In the following machine learning model training and testing questions, we use sklearn.train_test_split and the test_size is set as 0.3.

2. Because train_test_split gives different training and testing dataset everytime, when you try to reproduce the testing procedures, **the prediction error may differ a little from ours**.

Thanks for your peer review!
