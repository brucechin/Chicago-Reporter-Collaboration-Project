****Checkpoint1 Finding****

First I'd like to give answers from our proposal:

1.  what's the relation between average number of complaints received per year and the age of a police officer? older - >more complaints or something else?

    the young and too old police officers have much lower frequency of receiving complaints, but for those who are born between 1982 and 1941 have average **0.8** complaint receiving rate per officer and per year.

    which suggests those police officers who just start their career are good cops and devote to their work. As time pass by, they could be affected by others and start receiving complaints. As for those born before 1940, I guess because of insufficient recording of the complaints, their records of complaints are lower. Or simply in the past, Chicago PD is far better than now.

2.  Do those who receive no complaints get more awards?

    Sad results. 2/3 of the Chicago police officers have received complaints, but they recevie more than 90% of the
    awards(656116/(40073 + 656116)).

3. what's the average number of complaints received per year and officer?

    Chicago PD has received 244455 complaints in total. They have 22813 + 10858 = 33671 officers. And the dataset records the past 50 years complaints data. so the average number of complaints received per year and officer is : 244455 / (33671 * 50) = 0.145

4. what's the average number of complaints from different racial officers per year?

    | race | officer_count | number_officer_complained|number_complaint_count| resident_count | complaint_count_from_resident |
    | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
    |white|20671|13373|134710|1729593|17961|
    |black|7630|5697|66854|1712474|50322|
    |hispanic|4579|3290|38342|1569483|8494|
    |asian|539|385|3808|305590|712|
    |native american|62|53|648|4097|109|

    from the table we can conclude easily that there are racial discrimination when police officers deal with black residents. But for our question, it seems that police of different races have similar ratio of being complained. White officers have the lowest ratio of being complained(less than 0.7). 



5. what's the average income of those officers who have received complaints and the  average salary of the whole Chicago police officers?

    Sadly like the awards question, the average salary of those who ever received complaints are even a bit higher than the total avearge. I guess the Chicago PD won't give salary deduction as punishment for those who receive complaints. The Chicago PD may not take those complaints seriously. 

Extra thoughts for checkpoint-1:
