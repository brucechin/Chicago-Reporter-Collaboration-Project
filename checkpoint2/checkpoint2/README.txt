README for Checkpoint #2
JaCoya Thompson, Lianke Qin and Victor S. Bursztyn.
---------------------------------------

Pre-requisites:

Questions #1, #2, #3, and #4 (divided into #4a and #4b) require having loaded the CPDB dataset.


---------------------------------------

Questions and Instructions:

Tableau Chart #1 (or Question #1): What's the percentage of allegations sustained by each victim race?

You should execute the query in "src/q1.sql". Full context may be found in "findings.pdf."

Tableau Chart #2 (or Question #2): What's the distribution of investigation times?

You should execute the query in "src/q2.sql". Full context may be found in "findings.pdf."

Tableau Chart #3 (or Question #3): What's the frequency of each disciplinary action?

You should execute the query in "src/q3.sql". Full context may be found in "findings.pdf."

Interactive Visualization #1 (or Question #4): What's the influence of victim race on the last two distributions?

In essence, we are adding an interactive dimension "victim race" to Tableau Charts #2 and #3.

Our results for this question are fully available in a single Notebook at ObservableHQ:

https://observablehq.com/@vbursztyn/interactive-visualizations-of (with data hosted at our Github)

If you want to reproduce data generation, you should (i) execute the query in "src/q4a.sql" for the first part and consider the unit of results as days, and (ii) execute the query in "src/q4b.sql" for the second part. Full context may be found in "findings.pdf." Again, we strongly recommend accessing our Notebook at [ https://observablehq.com/@vbursztyn/interactive-visualizations-of ], where additional steps are documented.
